Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Pretty Princess Club, LLC
-------------------------

### What's with the name?

It's definitely a bit of internet snark that appealed to Nifty Nif, PPC, LLC HBIC. Nif also loves modern TLDs, and princess.club was a lot more expensive. Coincidentally, Pretty Princess Club was available for registration in Nifty Nif's home state.

### Who is PPC?

PPC is an LLC registered in Washington State, USA. It consists of one member, Nifty Nif.

### What else do you do?

Nifty is a software engineer by day. She also likes to play pinball, cook and bake, watch cartoons, and make costumes.

### What else does PPC do?

That remains to be seen! We incorporated in order to put on the [Royal Vegas Retreat](./vegas.html). Perhaps someday, pending the success of RVR, PPC will expand and help other Lolitas put on events.

EGL Fashion
-----------

### What is EGL?

EGL is short for "Elegant Gothic Lolita." "Lolita Fashion" is another name for it. It's a style of dress that originated in Japan and is associated with Harajuku fashion culture.

### I need an example.

### When is it?

Founders' Weekend will be November 15 - 17, 2019. It's at the same venue as RVR: MGM Grand, Las Vegas.

### How do I get an invite?

There are a few ways:

*   Buy a Founders' ticket during Kickstarter sales.
*   Offer to volunteer as con staff and buy any ticket to RVR.
*   Offer to volunteer as a panelist and buy any ticket to RVR.

### Why do I have to buy a ticket to RVR in order to go to Founders' Weekend?

At Founders' Weekend, we hope to come to some consensus on the aesthetic, content, and experience of RVR. If you're not going to RVR, why do you care?

### How much does it cost?

The cost of your hotel room, some food and beverages, and some entertainment will be covered by your Kickstarter donation or volunteer commitment. You will be personally liable for:
